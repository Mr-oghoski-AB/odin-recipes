            <h3> Steps </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Melt the butter in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and parsley; 
                        cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
                         Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, coffee, water, sugar, salt, and pepper. 
                         Bring the soup to a boil and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                   <p> <li>Pour the hot soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. 
                        Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. 
                        Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Stir in the cream and heat until warm. Do not boil.</li></p>
                </ol>
