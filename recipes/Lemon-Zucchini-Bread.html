        <p>This is THE BEST lemon zucchini bread I've ever baked or tasted. The recipe came from a friend of my mom's. She kept raving about this bread that she had made while she was visiting. After I made it the first time I can understand why. 
            If I don't put this in the freezer right away, it is gone!!! Butter is really good on this bread if you aren't worried about the calories, fat, etc.</p>
